This repository contains my personal configuration files (dotfiles) for creating a modern and productive terminal environment on macOS. The setup is automated via a simple installation script.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Terminal:** [Kitty](https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/), a fast, feature-rich, GPU-based terminal emulator.
- **Shell & Prompt:** Zsh + Oh My Zsh, with [Starship](https://starship.rs/) for a minimal, fast, and highly customizable prompt.
- **Theming:** A consistent [Catppuccin Mocha](https://github.com/catppuccin) theme across `kitty`, `bat`, and `yazi`.
- **Editor:** A pre-configured [Neovim (LazyVim)](https://neovim.io/) setup for a lightweight and efficient coding experience.
- **File Management:**
  - [Eza](https://github.com/eza-community/eza) as a modern replacement for `ls`.
  - [Yazi](https://github.com/sxyazi/yazi) as a terminal file manager with rich media previews.
  - [fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf) for lightning-fast fuzzy finding and history search.
- **Tools & Utilities:** [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) for package management, [bat](https://github.com/sharkdp/bat) for syntax highlighting, `zoxide` for intelligent directory jumping, and much more.

## üöÄ Installation

This setup is designed to be installed with a few simple commands.

> **‚ö†Ô∏è Warning:** The script will create backups of your existing configuration files (`.zshrc`, `.config/kitty`, etc.) before creating symbolic links to the files in this repository.

1. **Install a real terminal emulator:**
   Install and open [Kitty](https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/binary)
   ```bash
   curl -L https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/installer.sh | sh /dev/stdin
   open /Applications/kitty.app
   ```

2.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/ThibaultJRD/dotfiles.git
    cd dotfiles
    ```

3.  **Make the script executable:**
    Before running the script, you need to give it execution permissions.
    ```bash
    chmod +x install.sh
    ```

4.  **Run the installation script:**
    ```bash
    ./install.sh
    ```

5.  **Restart your terminal:**
    Close and reopen your terminal windows to load the new configuration. You may also need to set the Nerd Font in your terminal's settings to see all the icons correctly.

6. **Launch Tmux**
   ```bash
   tmux
   ```
