## üöÄ Installation

This setup is designed to be installed with a single command.

> **‚ö†Ô∏è Warning:** The script will create backups of your existing configuration files (`.zshrc`, `.config/kitty`, etc.) before creating symbolic links to the files in this repository.

1. **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO.git](https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO.git)

2. **Run the installation script:**

## Fonts

For a correct display of icons and symbols, this script installs the following "Nerd Fonts" via Homebrew:

- Caskaydia Cove Nerd Font
- Victor Mono Nerd Font
- Symbols Only Nerd Font

After installation, make sure to configure your terminal's font (e.g., in `kitty.conf` or your emulator's preferences) to use `CaskaydiaCove Nerd Font` or another "Nerd Font" of your choice.
